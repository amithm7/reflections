How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helps in viewing the changes which can be used to spot the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Trace back any bugs, where it started, etc.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros - Having control over versions
    Cons - User error

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Git is made for tracking inter-related files, while Google Docs are made for
    tracking one file at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log lists all commits to see the history of files and git diff can help
    in seeing what changes were made between those commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because with version control i can go back to any version temporarily to see
    what broke it.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Tracking my project
