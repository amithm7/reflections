When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When i would like to work with other people on a project or simply share
    code and the changes made.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    So as to only pull the changes or branches that you need.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks create copies of repositories, linked to original, a feature of GitHub
    While clones also create copies, it can be anywhere.
    Branches are part of a single repository to track different versions of code

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    Can work without internet access, remote's copy can be treated as a 
    seprerate branch and can be merged with local branch when needed.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be hard, sending files over some file-sharing service, and then
    disscussing changes. It would be difficult to work simultaneously.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
